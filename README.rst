Introduction
------------


When building a network simulation, biophysically detailed electrical models (e-models) need to be tested for every morphology that is possibly used in the circuit.

E-models can e.g. be obtained using `BluePyOpt <https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt>`_ by data-driven model parameter optimisation.
Developing e-models can take a lot of time and computing resources. Therefore, these models are not reoptimized for every morphology in the network.
Instead we want to test if an existing e-model matches that particular morphology 'well enough'.

This process is called Cell Model Management (MM). It takes as input a morphology release, a circuit recipe and a set of e-models with some extra information.
Next, it finds all possible (morphology, e-model)-combinations (me-combos) based on e-type, m-type, and layer as described by the circuit recipe, and calculates the scores for every combination.
Finally, it writes out the resulting accepted me-combos to a database, and produces a report with information on the number of matches.



Support
-------

We are providing support using a chat channel on `Gitter <https://gitter.im/BlueBrain/BluePyMM>`_.

Requirements
------------

* `Python 2.7+ <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/>`_ or `Python 3.6+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/>`_
* `pip 9.0+ <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ (installed by default in newer versions of Python, make sure you upgrade pip to a version 9.0+)
* `Neuron 7.4+ <http://neuron.yale.edu/>`_ (compiled with Python support)
* `eFEL eFeature Extraction Library <https://github.com/BlueBrain/eFEL>`_ (automatically installed by pip)
* `BluePyOpt <https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt>`_ (automatically installed by pip)
* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ (automatically installed by pip)
* `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ (automatically installed by pip)
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ (automatically installed by pip)
* `sh <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sh>`_ (automatically installed by pip)

Installation
------------


.. code-block:: bash

    pip install bluepymm

NOTES: 

* Make sure you are using the latest version of pip (at least >9.0). Otherwise the ipython dependency will fail to install correctly.
* Make sure you are using a new version of git (at least >=1.8). Otherwise some exceptions might be raised by the versioneer module.
